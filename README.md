# MB2-_project_task

In this project, the scPDSI (self-calibrated Palmer Drought Severity Index) over bavaria   
should be analyzed. The scPDSI stack is applied to a vector layer, representing       
the Landklif project quadrants. By this, regional patterns                            
in the scPDSI trend should be recognized and can furthermore be interpreted.          
The input data is under https://github.com/jakobwachter/MB2-_project_task.            
It is also available on the University M-Drive in the Landklif-Folder, or             
Carina KÃ¼bert as a responsible person for the project can provide it.                 
The results of this script will be an updated version of the input shapefile of the   
Landklif Quadrants for further analysis, including statistical scPDSI data for each   
quadrant, and graphs showing the scPDSI trends as a map as well as statistical        
illustrations.
